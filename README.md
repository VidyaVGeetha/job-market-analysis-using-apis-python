# Job Market Analysis Using APIs and Python

This project analyzes job market data collected through a Flask-based REST API and performs exploratory data analysis to identify trends in skills, job roles, and experience-level demand. The project demonstrates end-to-end data analytics workflow, including API data collection, data wrangling, visualization, and report generation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect job data using a Flask API
- Clean and process the dataset using Python and Pandas
- Identify in-demand skills and technologies
- Analyze job demand by experience level and job roles
- Export insights into a multi-sheet Excel report

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Flask (API Server)
- Requests (API Client)
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (OpenPyXL)


## 📊 Key Insights Generated
- Top in-demand skills (Python, SQL, JavaScript, etc.)
- Job demand by experience categories (0–2, 2–5, 5–10+ years)
- Most frequent job roles
- Skill frequency and technology usage patterns

## 🧾 Excel Report Output
The generated report contains multiple sheets:
- Raw_Job_Data
- Skill_Demand
- Experience_Demand
- Top_Job_Titles

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Start the Flask API (`Jobs_API.ipynb`)
2. Run the analysis notebook
3. Export results to Excel

## 📌 Business Insights
This analysis provides insights into current hiring patterns and workforce trends in the job market:
The highest demand is for candidates with 2–5 years of experience, indicating that companies prefer professionals who already have practical industry exposure rather than fresh graduates or highly senior profiles.
Technical skills such as JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and Python remain core hiring priorities, reflecting the continued need for web development, data processing, and software engineering talent.
A significant number of openings exist in Sales and Business Development roles, suggesting that many organizations are focusing on market expansion, client acquisition, and revenue growth activities.
Demand for roles such as PHP Developer, Java Developer, and Software Engineer highlights ongoing investment in product development and application maintenance.
The presence of roles like Graphic Designer and Content Writer shows that companies are also prioritizing digital marketing, content creation, and brand presence.
Consistent demand for IT support and infrastructure skills (Linux, MySQL, Technical Support) indicates the importance of maintaining stable operations and internal systems.
Overall, hiring trends suggest a balanced workforce demand across technical, business, and support functions, rather than being concentrated only in IT roles.
